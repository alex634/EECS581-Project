Time Estimates
===============================

**AI**

- Easy `1 Hour`

Firing randomly shouldn't be that hard to implement. Just more or less generating random numbers.

- Medium `3 Hours`

This will take longer than hard because there is more logic involved. Hitting positions orthogonally is harder than
picking known positions.

- Hard `1 Hour`

Shouldn't take long to implement, aiming at known locations.

- Place Ships `3 Hours`

Will probably take longer than implementing individual parts of the firing AI. Time isn't reduced by sharing components as is the case with AI.

**Custom Addition**

- Sound `2 Hours`

Involves finding sounds and making a class to play those sounds. Shouldn't be hard even if it does take some time to do this.

**Misc**

- Commenting Code `1 Hour`

Don't have good reasoning for this number, seemed like a good number.

**Total Time Estimate: 11 Hours**
